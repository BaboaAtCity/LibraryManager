# LibraryManager

This is a php cloud based application that allows a book store to have a search function for their inventory so customers are able to see if they have a certain book in stock. Admins are able to add/remove books from inventory and view the inventory from the admin panel which is only accessible by users that are logged in. The login system is secure and uses SHA1 hashing algorithm for web security.
